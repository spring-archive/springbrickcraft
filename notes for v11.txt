[04:39:52] <[LCC]GoogleFrog[0K]> could you make a wall building vehicle that can initially move around, then you can morph it into wall-layer
[04:40:00] <[LCC]GoogleFrog[0K]> which moves slowly and leaves wall behind it
[04:40:05] <[LCC]GoogleFrog[0K]> and dies after a while
[04:40:09] <[RoX]knorke> like tron?
[04:40:15] <[LCC]GoogleFrog[0K]> exactly like tron
[04:40:34] <[RoX]knorke> that would be fun if it works out

[04:41:23] <[LCC]GoogleFrog[0K]> unit moves, leaves smoke, remember smoke position
[04:41:44] <[LCC]GoogleFrog[0K]> when the unit runs out turn the positions into walls, snapping to buildingmap
[04:41:49] <[RoX]knorke> well the bombtruck is somewhat similiar if you give it unlimited bombs and hold down "b" while it moves
[04:41:52] <[LCC]GoogleFrog[0K]> a gaia owned wall structuve


[04:47:51] <[RoX]knorke> could also "shot" the wall
[04:47:02] <[RoX]knorke> pick a direction and the wall grows in that direction for some length
[04:47:02] <[LCC]GoogleFrog[0K]> what?
[04:47:07] <[LCC]GoogleFrog[0K]> that's good too

[04:57:54] <[LCC]GoogleFrog[0K]> with straight line wall deploy you could rotate it so it has a smooth edge


[04:17:25] <[LCC]GoogleFrog[0K]> the harvester controls
[04:17:33] <[LCC]GoogleFrog[0K]> you cannot tell them to move

[05:48:22] <[LCC]GoogleFrog[0K]> can you make minerals invisible?
[05:48:36] <[LCC]GoogleFrog[0K]> and reveal them at the start of the game so they ghost

[03:04:07] <[LCC]GoogleFrog[0K]> at worst you could make an invisible thing that you can always see, attack commands on it are transfered to minerals



gatling upgrade:
make extra barrels fall off on damage (only the upgraded ones, at 75% and 50%)
[06:14:54] <[RoX]knorke> would be possible to make it lose the extra barrels on damage
[06:15:00] <[LCC]GoogleFrog[0K]> yea that may work


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
[07:24:26] <[LCC]GoogleFrog[0K]> so I'd like to see gattling fix, tech applying to new units, harvester controllability, wall maker, unselectable rocket dude and heli buff (hp is probably ok)
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

buildtime gat 30sec


pass commands from transporters to passengers

miner fahren so kacke weil das ziel blockiert bei der rückkehr?

vierling damages the factory when it leaves and is shooting from inside :/
