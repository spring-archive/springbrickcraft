hello dear noob:
The big cube builds buildings.
The unit that stands in front of it is a harvester. it mines minerals and returns them to the cube for money. minerals = the blue stuff.

= SOUNDS SUCK and are wip.  press F6 or springsettings.exe->unit reply volume=0

There is no way to heal units yet.

What units will not disappoint?
The Dudes from the Barracks
Tank, Vierling in Factory

sirup is used for teching & upgrading
capture pumps with the "Otis" vehicle from the factory

buildicons with yellow background are upgrades.
do not build unless you really want them.

canceled buildings can not be resumed but time out (and you get resources back)
(its easy to accidently cancel buildings before they are finished so watch out)

to expand, build a PIONEER from the factory

somewhat good first-try BUILD ORDER:
1) Barracks 2) Factory 3) Make 1 or 2 extra MINERS from the factory 4) build units as needed
